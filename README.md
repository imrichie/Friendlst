# Friendlst üì±

## Overview

Friendlst is a portfolio app that lets you easily keep track of your friends by storing their profiles in one place. With Friendlst, you can save your friends' contact information, including their name, phone number, email address, add notes, and even a profile picture.

## Objective

The objective of this portfolio project was to create a user-friendly app that allows users to easily manage and organize their friends contact information. I wanted to create an app that was simple and intuitive to use, while also providing users with the ability to customize their friends' profiles with profile pictures.

## Technologies Used

* `CoreData` Friendlst uses CoreData to manage the storage of friend profiles in a local database on the device.
* `UIKit` Friendlst's user interface is built using UIKit components, including navigation controllers, table views, and buttons.
* `UIImagePickerController` Friendlst uses the UIImagePickerController to allow users to select images from their photo library or take a new photo.
* `UserDefaults` Save and display last screen visited by user

## Features

* Create and manage a list of your friends' profiles
* Save your friends' contact information, including their name, phone number, and email address and add comments
* Upload a profile picture for each friend
* Delete friends from your list

## Challenges

One of the challenges that I faced while building Friendlst was implementing the ability to upload profile pictures. I had to learn how to use `UIImagePickerController` to allow users to select images from their photo library or take a new photo with their device's camera. Also added a check to make sure that the device has a camera just in case they're using with an older device such as an iPod.  

Another challenge was managing the navigation flow between screens. I had to make sure that the user interface was intuitive and easy to navigate, while also providing users with all the necessary functionality.

## Future Improvements

There are several improvements that I would like to make to Friendlst in the future, including:

* Adding the ability to sort friends by name or date added
* Implementing a backup feature to allow users to save their friend profiles to the cloud
* Adding the ability to share friends' profiles with other users
* Include authentication services with Firebase to allow users to login with credentials

## Conclusion

Overall, Friendlst was a challenging but rewarding project to work on. I am proud of what I have accomplished and I believe that this app demonstrates my skills in iOS development, including my ability to work with CoreData and UIKit components.

## Swift and Xcode Versions
