# Friendlst 📱

## Overview
Friendlst is a portfolio application I created to showcase various skills. This application is your *friendliest* list of friends. Simple application to manage your favorite friends. You can add as many as you'd like and delete them as you go. 

Built with *UIKit* and persisting data with *Core Data* in the background. I also integrated the use of *UserDefaults* to save the state of the app so you'll always pick up where you left off. 

## Tools and Frameworks

* Core Data
